## Running it

Simply install and start with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

```
yarn
yarn start
```

# Or one-line-it
```
yarn && yarn start
```

## Running tests

```
yarn test
```

Styles and tests are very basic. Also eventually this could be improved by using [Sagas](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) instead of [Thunks](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk).

Enjoy.
